I have already used FluentMigrator for database migration and have used ClickOnce to deploy the app. I have also gone through almost every link over here to see how can I do it. I now know that its not possible using ClickOnce. Can anybody tell me some other way or may be some kind of hack?. I am using ClickOnce because of its auto update feature so don't really want to lose that functionality now.

I'm using a Mutualised Linux server with PHP Version 5.6.31 and MySQL(i) 5.7.19-log. And I've found a bug that doesn't happen on others servers, since some phpbb team members as some friend of mine couldnt reproduce the problem. But there is more people with the same problem. For people that want to check by themselves: Basically with a fresh install of phpBB 3.2.1, we can go to ACP - Forums - Your first category - Your first forum. There we confirmed that the option \"Enable quick reply\" is marked as \"No\" Then we go to ACP - Posting - Messages - Post Settings and click on \"Submit and enable quick reply in all forums\". After that we go again to the \"your first forum\" to check the \"Enable quick reply\" and its still as \"No\". And it should be \"Yes\". I've try to DEBUG and on the .php file that have the function that will create the SQL query that will be sent to database, I've put: print(1 << 6); and it gives me 64. So I've put too: print($bit); and it gives me 6. So the code (1 << $bit) that is on the php should be correct, and should give me 64 BUT if I put: print(1 << $bit); it gives me 32! I've put the 3 prints: And the result was: 64 6 32 Wtf?! Why the hell when we've an variable with 6 as value, it assumes as 5?!, or it assumes as the 6th position the representation of a byte? Anyone have any idea why this is happening? Maybe PHP versin bug? Or can any type of configuration mess with this? Let me explain better. In /includes/constants.php we can find: That value will be use to create the $bit value. And on /includes/acp/acp_board.php we've a function that will create the $bit variable: This _enable_bitfield_column_flag_ function is what will create the sql code. And the log(FORUM_FLAG_QUICK_REPLY, 2) = Log2(64) = 6. So that's why the $bit is 6. And in includes/functions_admin.php we've: We can see here the sql code being created by php code. And finally on /phpbb/db/driver/driver.php we've: And before that line I've put the 3 prints, and the values were 64 6 32... and it doesnt make sense, why print $bit gives 6 and 1 << $bit gives 32...

We know that if that happens, will return . But then what will do? Can you use , and any exception thrown? It's not clear ... the documentation says, The result and whether this method throws an exception when the column value is null or the column type is not a string type is implementation-defined. But it doesn't say anything about exceptions or other specified behavior for a of -1. My testing on a few devices indicates that you get this exception: Can we count on that exception being thrown? Another way to do it is to check the index returned by before calling : But using that many lines per column seems verbose, and violates the DRY principle, lending itself to careless errors in the code. I wouldn't mind the repetition if we could extract that code into a separate method to be called for each column. But I don't see any simple way to do it, because the columns can have different types. (We could subclass CursorWrapper and implement , , etc. to do the checking we want, thus confining the repetition to a specialized utility class. Is that the best we can do?) Another approach would be using instead of . That would allow you to skip the step of saving the value of and testing it, because you can count on an exception being thrown if is -1 (and catch it). But that doesn't perform very well: If you're not sure if a column will exist or not use getColumnIndex(String) and check for -1, which is more efficient than catching the exceptions.

Diagnostics have led us to believe there may be a bug in a DLL that is used by one of the processes running on this server that is resulting in a global atom leak. The assumed vector is a process that is calling RegisterClass without a corresponding UnregisterClass (and the class name is using a random number as part of the name, so it's a different class name each time the process starts). This article provided some information: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ntdebugging/2012/01/31/identifying-global-atom-table-leaks/ But we are reluctant to attempt kernel mode debugging on a production server, so we have tried installing windbg and using the !gatom command to list atoms for a given session. I use windbg to attach to a process in one of the sessions (these processes are running as Windows Services if that matters), then invoke the !gatom command. The returned atom list doesn't have any window classes in it. Then I read this: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20150429-00/?p=44984 and it sounds like there is a separate atom table for windows classes. And no way to query it. I was hoping that we'd be able to actually see how many windows class atoms have been registered, and see if that list gets bigger over time, indicating a leak. The documentation on !gatom is sparse, and I'm hoping I can get some expert confirmation or recommendations on how to proceed. Does anyone have any ideas on how we can get at the list of registered Windows classes on a production server? More detail about what happens when the server starts to misbehave: We run many instances (>50) of the same application as separately registered services running from isolated executables and DLLs - so each of those 50 instances has their own private executables and DLLs. During their normal run, the processes unload and reload a DLL (about every hour). There is a windows class used that's part of a \"session handle\" used by the DLL (the session handle is part of the registered windows class name), and that session handle is unique each time the DLL is loaded. So every hour, there is an additional Window class registration, made by a DLL (our service stays running). After some period of time, the system will get into a state where further attempts to load the DLL in question fail. This may happen for one of the services, then gradually over time, other services will start to have the same problem. When this happens, restarting the service does not fix the problem. The only way that we've found to get things running properly again is to reboot the server. We are monitoring memory commit load, and we are well within the virtual memory of the server. We are even within the physical memory size. I just did a code review the vendor of the DLL, and it looks like they are not actually calling RegisterClass from the DLL itself (they only make one RegisterClass call from the DLL, and it's a static string - not a different class name for each session). The DLL launches an EXE, and that EXE is the one that registers the session specific class name. Their EXE does call UnregisterClass (and even if it didn't, the EXE is terminated when we unload their DLL, so it seems that this may not be what is going on). I am now out of bullets on this one. The behavior seems like some sort of resource leak or pool exhaustion. The next time this happens, I will try connecting to the failing process with windbg and see what the application atom pool looks like - but I'm not hopeful that is going to shed any light. Update: The excellent AtomTableMonitor tool has narrowed the problem to rogue RegisterWindowMessage. I'm going to ask a more specific question focused on this exact issue: Diagnosing RegisterWindowsMessage leak"},{"id":46398145,"title":"Spark-Application to Local Directory","created_at":"2017-09-25 05:28:55.750000+00:00","modified_at":"2019-10-31 03:07:18.833000+00:00","tags":["scala","apache-spark","hortonworks-data-platform","spark-submit"],"path":"","file_type":"blog","language":"en","github_stars":0,"view_count":0,"source":"Stack Overflow","content":"PROBLEM Spark Application error due to Mkdirs failed to create.

However, browser password managers keep offering to auto-fill the fields, an activity which simply makes no sense in this context. In fact, in my opinion, the practice is actively insecure, because it increases the likelihood that people will choose passwords \"similar\" to what they currently have, by accepting what is offered by the password manager and making minor adjustments. (just a quick note that there's no need to mention that safeguards to ensure difference can be put in place as I'm aware of this - thanks) I have already done a lot of research to try to disable the password managers, including: autocomplete=\"off/new-password/rubbish value\" (for both form and type=\"password\" fields, separately and at the same time) using javascript to change the field from type=\"text\" to type=\"password\" on focus inserting hidden password fields prior to the password field on the form removing name and id from the field But, while some approaches work partially, nothing works consistently. The only thing that I can find to do that seems to have shot at succeeding is using a type=\"text\" and displaying circles by using a dummy \"password\" font . However, this approach feels like I am fighting the browsers, and I just cannot credit that there is no easy way to enter \"hidden\" text without having the password manager involved. Additional notes: I have already tried everything on How to prevent a browser from storing password and none of the solutions offered work reliably. Mozilla has a whole explanation of how to do it here ...which doesn't work. Hence this question. Is there possibly any password guru out there who knows how to disable the password managers when entering hidden text?

The code generation process programmatically adds/removes items to csproj file. The workflow is as follows: a developer adds a new C# interface, or removes an existing C# interface in Visual Studio 2017. If the developer saves the project file first then runs the code generator, then everything works as expected. Code-generated assets are either added to the project (or removed) and Visual Studio reflects those changes accordingly. However, if the developer fails to save the csproj file before running code generator, and has deleted a C# interface, then the code-generated assets are not being removed from the project because Visual Studio is not accepting the csproj file modifications. Inside the code generator, I'm physically removing the references to the code-generated files that are deleted and am saving the csproj file. I verify that the referenced files are removed from the csproj file by opening the csproj up in notepad. However, as soon as I bring Visual Studio into focus, Visual Studio recognizes that the csproj file has changed and asks if I want to discard, overwrite, save as, etc and the changes made to csproj file from my code generation process are lost. Visual Studio adds the references to the deleted files back into the csproj file. I've tried discard, overwrite, save as, etc and I'm not getting Visual Studio to accept the newly modified csproj file (which has the references to deleted files removed). Here's my code for removing code-generated assets: Is it possible to have Visual Studio just accept the new csproj file? Is there some setting I need to make to csproj file when removing assets? Having Visual Studio balk at the modified csproj file is hindering the usefulness of the code generator for removing code-generated assets no longer needed (stemming from physically deleting a C# interface file). EDIT Here's a video showing the process of running the T4 generator inside Visual Studio generating C# assets based on a C# interface. I delete the source C# interface, re-run code generator and the project file is updated accordingly causing the project to be reloaded. https://www.screencast.com/t/JWTE0LpkXZGX The problem isn't that the project gets reloaded. The problem is the code generator updates and saves the csproj file outside of Visual Studio, which causes Visual Studio to be confused because the csproj file changed. How do you get Visual Studio to 'silently' accept the changes saved to csproj file?

First, I paste the list and parameters into a worksheet, and then I have a separate worksheet for each custom email, using some nested IF statements to show each file on the correct worksheet, like this: All of this works how I want it, each file gets grouped together how I want it. Next, I want to use VBA to then send out emails for each file on each worksheet, and every file on a single worksheet will get the same general email, except with cell references for specific parameters like name and file number. This code is also working fine with multiple worksheets in a test file I was running, however, the next step is giving me trouble, because in the test file I was using actual values to test the email VBA code, but the actual file uses formulas. So, for example when it's looking for the it just sees the formula that references the email address on a different sheet, and not the result of that formula. I have a \"simple\" solution, which is to run a macro that does a copy>special paste on each sheet before running the email script... but that clears out all the formulas, and I'd have to keep a backup file in case it gets saved or something, and that just seems like a workaround for not knowing how to code it correctly. Is there a simple way that when referencing a cell value like that it will just evaluate the formula in the cell and use the result? I tried using the Evaluate function in VBA, but that didn't seem to be working right either for doing multiple rows. Any ideas?

Ideally, I would like to compute both Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho for the set of all the copies of these pairs, which consists of k 1 + k 2 + ... + k n pairs. The problem is that k 1 + k 2 + ... + k n , the total number of observations, is huge and such a data structure won't fit in the memory. Naturally, I thought about assigning the frequency of i -th pair, k i /(k 1 + k 2 + ... + k n ) , as its weight, and computing rank correlation for the weighted set — but I couldn't find any tools for that. In the weighted varieties of rank correlation I met (e.g., scipy.stats.weightedtau ), the weights represent the importance of ranks and not pairs, which is not relevant for my cause. Pearson's r seems to have exactly the weighting option I need, but it doesn't fit my purpose as x and y are nowhere linearly related. I was wondering if I'm missing out on some notion for generalized correlation on weighted data points. The only idea I've got so far is to scale down k 1 , k 2 , ..., k n by some common factor c , so that scaled number of copies of i -th pair is [k i /c] (here [.] is the rounding operator, as we need to have integer number of copies of each pair). By choosing c such that [k 1 /c] + [k 2 /c] + ... + [k n /c] pairs can fit into memory, we could then compute the correlation coefficients tau and rho for the resulting set. However, k i and k j can differ by many orders of magnitude, so c can be significantly big for some k i and thus rounding k i /c can cause information loss. UPD: One can compute Spearman's rho along with p-value on a dataset with specified frequency weights as below: The particular example above shows that both methods produce same correlations and same p-values:"},{"id":46206624,"title":"Call a function with user arguments as function name and its arguments","created_at":"2017-09-13 20:50:10.087000+00:00","modified_at":"2017-09-13 21:37:05.157000+00:00","tags":["c++","c++11"],"path":"","file_type":"blog","language":"en","github_stars":0,"view_count":0,"source":"Stack Overflow","content":"I am new to C++, and would appreciate if you could help me with this.

The view I want to refresh: The view I want to refresh automatically contains the following script, whose function is to subscribe to the event of changing a table in the DB. Like the code above, this code is the same between both versions of the web app. The Hub: When you load the view and run that script, the following hub code is accessed in the backend. The first part of the code seems to work just fine in both versions of the web application: But the second code automatically runs only on one of the versions of the web application.

For starters, capturing the screen data I have the following code: Now the code is working as expected and the Bitmap created is correct. The first problem I am running into with this code is the speed. I haven't timed out the speed in milliseconds for execution, however I can say that the code is wrapped and executed to update a Bitmap repeatedly in its own thread, and on a screen that is 1000 x 600 pixels it updates at around 45 to 50 times per second. If the screen size is larger the execution rate drops significantly, for example capturing the window that is 1440 x 900 will drop the updates to 20 times per second or less. The second problem I am having is the bitmap is being stored/updated repeatedly from one thread, and I have other threads that need to access that Bitmap (or portion of). The problem is that when the main update thread writes to the Bitmap, and another thread attempts to read the bitmap, I obviously get the \"Object already in use elsewhere\" error. By multithreaded I mean Tasks like this: So what is the best way to store the bitmap (ie as a bitmap or byte[] or some other way) and access it from other threads. I have been playing with the idea of converting it to byte[] data (using LockBits and Marshal.Copy) but haven't determined yet if that is the correct route. Questions: Is there a way to improve the speed of getting the image data (maybe using a byte[] and somehow only 'updating' the changed pixel data). How can I make it thread safe. I will have one main thread updating it constantly (write only) I will have many threads that will need to read all or part (read only) Caveat: The window may or may not be DirectX / OpenGL (which was why I chose this method over others originally) EDIT/UPDATES: I have made the following changes which has improved performance slightly. - gfxBmp is now a static property initialized with the instance constructor - removed the event handler (class no longer needs to throw events notifying that the image was updated) - access to image property is wrapped with ReaderWriterLockSlim (and reading from other threads seems to be working great) As noted, all possible overhead has been removed and the Task now looks like this: My refresh method looks like: The CountFrame is irrelevant in the speed as I benchmarked with and without as follows: So the thread safety problem appears to be fixed, optimizations have been done as noted. So I am now still struggling with the speed. As you can see with the FrameRate drop at 1402 x 828, the question of a better way of capture is still not clear. Currently I am using Graphics.CopyFromScreen(...) to get the pixels, which I understand uses bitblt internally. Is there maybe another method of getting the data from the region of the screen possibly with something like pixel/byte data comparisons and only updating changed information, or other resources I should be looking at?"},{"id":46472196,"title":"Issue with pagination through firebase","created_at":"2017-09-28 14:52:29.350000+00:00","modified_at":"2017-09-28 16:42:09.103000+00:00","tags":["ios","swift","firebase","firebase-realtime-database","pagination"],"path":"","file_type":"blog","language":"en","github_stars":0,"view_count":0,"source":"Stack Overflow","content":"So I am having this problem with my pagination where it will not get the next N elements I hold a reference to the last key to fire off the pulling of the next N keys/elements but the second time around it seems to never pull the next N elements.

I'm facing a problem that I can not get through, and I'm very happy if you can help. First of all, I would like to explain the algorithm in a very simplified way. In the while loop, I print to Pc \"STARTED\" through the UART-Serial converter. Next, I set the RTC alarm to 10 seconds later. And the finally I sleep the MCU by using STOP MODE. After 10 seconds, MCU wakes up properly. So far everything is normal. After MCU wake up, I call the System Clock Config function. I print \"woken-up\" on the PC screen through UART. I can work this way forever But I do not like the current that circuit consume. To reduce the power consumption, I set all the pins to analog before entering sleep mode. this method worked very well on reducing current consumption. But after all the pins are analog and MCU goes sleep and wake up, the MCU can not send to string to PC. I think UART Module does not work properly... But I/O's and systick timer are running. I can understand this by toggling the LED in a certain delay(with HAL_DELAY) Why I can not make it work with reinit all peripherals? Here is my main code Solved Well, I checked the Hal functions line by line. And I saw that after first peripheral initialization (uart,i2c,adc etc.), Hal functions do not allow re-init again by checking that particular peripherals instant state. For example, In HAL_UART_Init(&huart2) function, In order to Init the low level hardware: (GPIO,CLOCK) the instant uart modules state must be UART_STATE_RESET. In here To overcome this problem, I reset that particular state of peripheral init. Because without not clearing those flags, uart init functions does not enter HAL_UART_MspInit(huart); I know that is bulky solution, but it works for now."},{"id":46392394,"title":"Error with H2O in R - can't connect to local host","created_at":"2017-09-24 16:40:59.323000+00:00","modified_at":"2018-01-17 04:39:49.550000+00:00","tags":["r","h2o"],"path":"","file_type":"blog","language":"en","github_stars":0,"view_count":0,"source":"Stack Overflow","content":"I can't get the h2o to work in my R.

UPDATE While the previous answer to this question does indeed work: I am afraid that the code is extremely slow as I am updating the extension of 'i_e' by adding 1 to it with each iteration of the inner while loop... To solve this I wanted to create a 'counter' variable that will extend the 'i_e' variable dynamically. This will be done with recursion whereby the i_e variable will be increased exponentially up until the point where half the desired distance is reached and then will be exponentially decreased until the desired distance is reached. Strategy illustration My attempt at this is as follows: I created a recursive a function to update a variable 'counter' Calling the function within the original code: I get the following error: (Printed thousands of times) I am not experienced with this kind of problem and am not sure if I am approaching it correctly... can anyone help?"},{"id":46366901,"title":"Julia fails to multiple dispatch","created_at":"2017-09-22 14:17:01.073000+00:00","modified_at":"2017-09-22 16:00:58.053000+00:00","tags":["julia"],"path":"","file_type":"blog","language":"en","github_stars":0,"view_count":0,"source":"Stack Overflow","content":"v06 I want to write a signature that expect 2 to 3 arguments.

Does anyone have any tip or any kind of material that I can read about it to start the implementation? Thanks in advance for the help. Files generated by the engine: ***** UPDATE 08/10/2017 ***** So, I'm implementing this on Amazon S3 with CloudFront and this is what I found out that is needed to make it work: 1 - All the gziped files generated must be renamed if you're going to use Amazon S3. What you need to do is remove the \"gz\" part of the name. 2 - In the .html file generated by Unreal, there's a line that says: that must be editted to: 3 - Rename the .html file to index.html or create a new index.html file that redirects to the .html generated by Unreal. 4 - After you upload all your files to Amazon as a Static Website, you'll need to open your Amazon S3 folder that contains the files (it's called Bucket on Amazon) and add this information to the metadata of each gziped file: This will make Amazon S3 recognize the file is gziped when needed. 5 - Grant public access for reading operations to all the files. 6 - Grant public access for reading operations and to \"list objects\" for the bucket. Also, implement this policy for the bucket: All these steps will make Amazon recognize gziped files and serve them when needed. This also solve the problems with error 403 and 404. But still, after all this, I'm facing this error: This happens when I use the new Wasm file generation for Unreal.

What if I'd written: Surely then, a new object will be created in the second line? How does Javascript specifically decide to write a new object or to keep the existing one? The section of the book that made me draw my conclusions says: In ECMAScript 3, regular-expression literals always share the same RegExp instance, while creating a new RegExp via constructor always results in a new instance. Consider the following: In the first loop, there is only one instance of RegExp created for /cat/, even though it is specified in the body of the loop. Instance properties (mentioned in the next section) are not reset, so calling test() fails every other time through the loop. This happens because the “cat” is found in the first call to test(), but the second call begins its search from index 3 (the end of the last match) and can’t find it. Since the end of the string is found, the subsequent call to test() starts at the beginning again.

The database just kept something like Now I'm trying to advance a bit from Google Script and are writing the same web app again but I can't understand where to start and/or what direction to take?

I can't figure out how to do things server side as before.. Besides, it seems as modifying the DOM as a string server side before serving client (templated Html in Google script) is very amateur-ish as it has absolutely zero SEO as far as I'm concerned of SEO.. I can't imagine this is how google would do themselves. I saw a few examples where people are putting out tags then looping through the DOM to replace them client side.. Which also seem a really slow and bad idea, where the tags often are visible for a second for the user before changed (not to mention the lacking of SEO again).

The application runs ok on Server 2008 and locally, but not on Server 2012. I have rebuilt the project after upgrading Magick.Net from 6.8.7.502 to 7.0.7.300, in the hope that the .Net Standard / .Net Core support mentioned in the Readme , introduced in 7.0.6, would solve my problem, but to no avail.

While it is a 64-bit server, the AppPool does have Enable 32-bit applications set to True . Changing the AppPool's Managed Pipeline Mode from Integrated to Classic also has no effect. I do note, however, that the number of applications for the AppPool is listed as zero (despite the website's advanced settings dialog showing the correct AppPool name): I am completely at a loss and we are behind schedule on the migration of this application now, so any suggestions would be gratefully received.

In particular, I've been looking at using Azure Active Directory for authentication of employees, local accounts for authentication of other users external to the company and controlling authorisation through roles in the app. Reading through the source code app.Use appears to simply add object types and options to a queue in OWIN to be called at some later point when invoked. I'm therefore struggling to understand the order of requests and where cookies are specifically created. I can see that the OwinContext.Authentication appears to control logins by creating an AuthenticationResponseGrant but I can't see where these are then used to then create cookies or where the cookies are read. I have managed to get everything working using above and then adding claims for Roles manually using: However, I would like to understand how this all integrates together much better than I do. What role does the AuthenticationType play? What reads this and differentiates between ApplicationCookie, Cookies, ExternalCookie etc.? How does 1 cookie get read when Azure AAD is being used but another for the ExternalUsers? As an aside previous to this we were using 2 user databases, 1 for employees and 1 for external users but we struggled to get it to work successfully. The problem being that the authenticationprovider validator seemed to get overridden by the second use of app.UseCookieAuthentication and log-out other users after 30 mins as it failed. We tried to create a Custom SecurityStampValidator to cope with this but couldn't get this to work. It feels like all this is tied together. All thoughts and links on how this all fits together appreciated. I've seen lots of bits and pieces but nothing seems to go into the detail of what is happening when and where. Thanks. Edit In response to Juan's comment the previous approach using 2 databases had 2 usermanagers to handle the different types of user. The OWIN set-up then had 2 calls to app.UseCookieAuthentication. The second call being something like: i.e. identical bar the different user classes. The problem was that OnValidateIdentity always failed after 30 mins for 1 user type. Edit2: Here's the full code of the setup of the old problem (but note my main issue is understanding how these various cookie options all work and interact as I am no longer using the below as we've moved to using Azure AD for internal users): Any logins of InternalUser would be auto logged out after 30 mins. Edit3: After reading around some more it seemed that the AuthenticationType was the key parameter. I therefore took that old code above and change the AuthenticationType to \"InternalUserCookie\" and \"ExternalUserCookie\" - I also added to the constructor of the signin managers a line to set the AuthenticationType here to these as well thinking this would match up. Making this change though just means the login isn't retained at all and no cookies..."},{"id":46226797,"title":".not in jquery not working","created_at":"2017-09-14 19:22:50+00:00","modified_at":"2017-09-14 19:48:09.297000+00:00","tags":["jquery","css","html"],"path":"","file_type":"blog","language":"en","github_stars":0,"view_count":0,"source":"Stack Overflow","content":"After much of research over google and various forums, I am posting this question here.

Basically, the executing thread needs access to different types of data depending on what type of schedule is being executed. To do this, I've come up with 3 approaches: dynamic_cast to each Derived type and check for NULL dynamic_cast based on a pure virtual GetScheduleType() function in the base Schedule class Implement all derived functions in the base class to throw a NotImplementedException so that if the executioner tries to call GetTemperature on a DeviceSchedule, the code would crash.

I've seen answers on SO that dislike both, dynamic_cast as well as the NotImplementedException approach, adding to my existing confusion :-). (Note that this is a simplified example.

However I find that I also dislike the use of custom vector/list/map classes and find creating an interface in classes to export their functionality to be tedious an repetitive, so I have come to the conclusion that I am just going to try and wrap said objects to the best of my ability (and accept whatever performance impact that has). That said I was wondering if you all could sanity check what I have done so far. So this is the road I have gone down (tested with vector first). I have created a class very similar to std::vector just named vector. The intent is to include it from another file inside a namespace so the the new vector doesn't conflict with anything else. I am working on an openCl library at the moment so that's what the code is coming from. opencl_std.h opencl.cpp OPENCL_UTIL_EXPORT is the obligatory dllimport/dllexport and OPENCL_UTIL_EXTERN sets the class to extern when importing. std_wrappers\\vector.h includes the declaration of the class and std_wrappers\\vector.cpp includes the definition. All though the class is a template the split declaration/definition works as the class is explicitly instantiated with this call (as well as exported). std_wrappers\\vector.h std_wrappers\\vector.cpp I left out a few functions as I don't believe I can make them work (basically any function that has its own template) and I had to take some care with the rvalue reference function but I think I got it correct. I have compiled and ran this all in VS2015 and everything seems kosher (granted thats not saying much for the rest of the compilers). I am getting a C4661 warning on the explicit template instantiation. but I think that it is purely a warning as it is defined just not before the instantiation happens. I expected the C4251 warning from this line, but I didn't see one, considering it is a pointer the compiled versions should agree on its size anyway. Using cl::util::vector<::size_t> from the library works fine. I have even tried to use cl::util::vector<::int> and got link warnings as I expected (as it was never instantiated). I plan to do this with some of the other templates, list, map, unordered_map, string, etc... just looking for a check if I missed something.

I've read the IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 Standard, XSH, Sections 2.5 and 2.5.1 (\"Interaction of File Descriptors and Standard I/O Streams\"), and from what I've understood, this should work, except that I may need to add right before the fork if standard error happened to be buffered. Is that correct? Are there other pitfalls to be aware of? Also, the same standard states in Section 2.5 that The address of the FILE object used to control a stream may be significant; a copy of a FILE object need not necessarily serve in place of the original. Can I take this to mean that a object inherited across fork() is safe to use?

It actually consist of a single compilation unit where the makefile lists as only source the . This headerfile then includes all the source files the project consists off, so it looks like a really big list of this: While trying to understand the logic behind it and I realized that this is indeed working for this project, as it's just an interface where each unit can operate without accessing any other unit, at some point I asked him what are the reasons why he did it this way.

So for now I'm applying the \"usual\" structure to the implementation I'm writing right now, while doing only mandatory changes to the whole project, to demonstrate how I would have designed it.

I think my biggest issue is that I don't really understand what is going on at a memory/hardware level. I understand that a pointer simply holds a memory address, and a pointer to a pointer simply holds a memory address to an another memory address, a short breadcrumb trail to what we really want. Yet, now that I am introducing malloc() to expand the amount of memory allocated, I seem to lose sight of whats going on. In fact, I am not really sure how to think of memory at all anymore. So, a char takes up a single byte, correct? If I understand correctly, then by a char* takes up a single byte of memory? If we were to have a: Would it be say safe to assume that it takes up 6 bytes of memory (including the null character)? And, if we wanted to allocate memory for some \"size\" unknown at compile time, then we would need to dynamically allocate memory. Is this syntactically correct so far? Now, if you would judge my interpretation. We are telling the compiler that we need \"size\" number of contiguous memory reserved for chars. If size was equal to 10, then str* would point to the first address of 10 memory addresses, correct? Now, if we could go one step further. This is where my feet start to leave the ground. My interpretation is that file_read() looks something like this: Adding the characters to the buffer and allocating the memory is what is I cannot seem to wrap my head around. If **buffer is pointing to *str which is equal to null, then how do I allocate memory to *str and add characters to it?

Its totally surprising to see this result. Am using the GCC version 5.4.1 on both. Also tried compiling using the -Ofast and -ffast-math but didn't make any difference. Also tried fetching the latest gcc 7.2 on the bare metal but again it didn't make any difference whatsoever. Also tried fetching the latest libm (glibc) and tried with no difference in the numbers at all. Can someone please help in letting me know where things are going wrong? Also running callgrind over the program (am using a third party so library and so have no control over it), I see most of the time being spent in libm. The only difference between the two environments other than the server version is the libm version. On VM which performed well it was 2.15 and on the bare metal which takes more time it is 2.23.

The callgrind graph is as follow: callgrind graph More updates: Tried -fopenacc and -fopenmp on both baremetal and vm ubuntu on the same g++ 7.2. The vm showed a little improvement but the baremetal ubuntu is showing the same number again and again. Also since the majority of the time spent is in libm, is there any way to upgrade that library ?(glibc) ? Don't see any new version of it in apt-cache though Used callgrind and plotted a graph using dot. According to that it takes 42.27% time in libm exp (version 2.23) and 15.18% time in libm log. Finally found a similar post (so pasting it here for others): The program runs 3 times slower when compiled with g++ 5.3.1 than the same program compiled with g++ 4.8.4, the same command The problem as suspected was from the libs (according to the post). And by setting the LD_BIND_NOW the execution times came down drastically (and now less than VM). Also that post has couple of links to bugs that were filed for that version of glibc.

Is it 13.3.3.1.4/1 on overload resolution of reference binding? EDIT 1 I argue on 13.3.3.1.4/1 because of the following reasons: 13.3/2 Overload resolution selects the function to call in seven distinct contexts within the language. [...] invocation of a constructor for direct-initialization (8.5) of a class object (13.3.1.3) ; [...] Each of these contexts defines the set of candidate functions and the list of arguments in its own unique way. But, once the candidate functions and argument lists have been identified, the selection of the best function is the same in all cases: First, a subset of the candidate functions (those that have the proper number of arguments and meet certain other conditions) is selected to form a set of viable functions ( 13.3.2 ). Then the best viable function is selected based on the implicit conversion sequences ( 13.3.3.1 ) needed to match each argument to the corresponding parameter of each viable function. 13.3.2/1 From the set of candidate functions constructed for a given context ( 13.3.1 ), a set of viable functions is chosen, from which the best function will be selected by comparing argument conversion sequences for the best fit ( 13.3.3 ). The selection of viable functions considers relationships between arguments and function parameters other than the ranking of conversion sequences. 13.3.1.3/1 When objects of class type are direct-initialized (8.5), or copy-initialized from an expression of the same or a derived class type (8.5), overload resolution selects the constructor . 13.3.3.1/5 For the case where the parameter type is a reference , see 13.3.3.1.4 . 13.3.3.1.4/1 When a parameter of reference type binds directly (8.5.3) to an argument expression, the implicit conversion sequence is the identity conversion , [...] And therefore, I conclude that the requirement of identity conversion results in requiring the prioritization of over . But, the other party I am arguing with is not convinced. So, I ask here. EDIT 2 The following is the link between 23.3.6.5 and 13.3.3.1.4 : First, 23.3.6.5 requires the following of : [...] Remarks: [...] If an exception is thrown other than by the copy constructor, move constructor, assignment operator, or move assignment operator of T or by any InputIterator operation there are no effects. [...] That is covered by 23.3.6.1/2 that requires the following: A vector satisfies all of the requirements of a container and of a reversible container (given in two tables in 23.2), [...] That is, is expected to comply with 23.2.1/7 that specifies the following: Unless otherwise specified, all containers defined in this clause obtain memory using an allocator (see 17.6.3.5). and with 23.2.1/3 that specifies the following: For the components affected by this subclause that declare an , objects stored in these components shall be constructed using the function and destroyed using the allocator_traits<allocator_type>::destroy function ( 20.7.8.2 ). These functions are called only for the container’s element type, not for internal types used by the container. Since 20.7.8.2 specifies only one function as follows: with 20.7.8.2/5 requiring the following: Effects: calls if that call is well-formed; otherwise, invokes . and 20.7.9.2/12 requiring the following of the default allocator: Effects: , both in 20.7.8.2/5 and in 20.7.9.2/12 will follow the constructor overload resolution requirement in 13.3.3.1.4/1 . The standard therefore requires the implementers to prioritize the use of move-constructor over copy-constructor when re-allocates its elements due to operations."},{"id":46306932,"title":"Understanding the std::search predicate","created_at":"2017-09-19 17:54:14.563000+00:00","modified_at":"2017-09-19 18:13:51.363000+00:00","tags":["c++","c++11"],"path":"","file_type":"blog","language":"en","github_stars":0,"view_count":0,"source":"Stack Overflow","content":"I am trying to understand the s predicate which I read about from here .

I am able to get into the API of the UV4L streaming server which has Multiple applications like JITSI, WEBRTC, JANUS etc. I noticed when I try to stream to Janus Video room on a local area connection (LAN) i.e. on my local server I get this message in the terminal \"[6889886769210913] Creating ICE agent (ICE Full mode, controlled) [6889886769210913] The DTLS handshake has been completed WebRTC media is now available\" But no media/video stream shows up. I enabled Data channels while compiling Janus, and I also did a webrtc test with my UV4L streaming server which worked fine. But the message with Janus and why the stream doesn't show up in either Chrome or Firefox is what I need help with. Edit Update to answer a comment: The link between both is that the uv4l renders my IP cam as virtual device driver, I am using mjpeg driver module. I can then pass different options to the uv4l driver while loading it, for example I use an h264 profile stream from the IP Cam, and I also change it to mjpeg stream as well too. The funny thing is that with the h264 stream, I can run webrtc stream tests on the virtual driver created, even on Janus looking at the debug files, everything seems to work the way its supposed to, after a hangup I get the correct logs e.g My feeds goes over the wire properly tracing with Wireshark just as the successful Webrtc stream tests are displayed over the wire, my packet headers and feeds come out fine as such : I am thinking the reason why I get no stream is because I am not testing it on an encrypted layer over the browser, i.e am not using HTTPS instead HTTP, or my host windows machine is blocking my guest Linux webrtc stream. These are the areas I tend to investigate upon, I also tried with local host, same result no stream shown, its kind of a complex policy issue for me to create a self signed cert on my VM because of privacy restrictions. I would look further and if I find no alternative I'd create a self signed license on a stanadlone machine to test it. Do you think the ssl issue might be the cause?

For the sake of full automation, I developed a C# application which plays the role of execution engine(called TAMS). Therefore right after each round of deployment, testers can let this application run and wait for the results (no more hands-on needed). But the final goal is to launch the application by the build server, right after a successful deployment. So my approach is that: build server(Jenkins) sends a REST request to the test server which hosts my application(execution engine) and my application will execute the test scripts and finally send back a summary to our build server. As all three servers(Build server, application server and test server) are physically separated, I came up with following implementation idea: Implementation: there is a Web API Self-Hosting using windows service, waiting for a REST(get) request including a parameter. Once it receives the request, it should launch an application(which has a UI) on the same machine. My UI application is not running, it is supposed to get woken up by the web API(as a windows service). so my solution is taking following steps: 1) client enters the following sample URL: http://myserver:8080/values/GetString/[ProjectName] 2) Web API Self-Hosting receives the request 3) ValuesController(GetString) is responsible to launch the windows application and passing the \"projectName\" value to it. Everything is working except for launching the app (nothing happens by each call, although at client side I get the expected returned dummy message with no exception!).

Why are they this big? How can I reduce their size or get rid of them (I don't need vfprintf at all since I don't have a file system on the microcontroller)? Are there any further techniques to reduce the binary size? How would I proceed in my quest? Edit (Clarification on the reason for the optimization): There are different versions of the ESP32 with up to 16 MB of flash memory. The one we use has 4 MB. 1 MB of that is reserved for storing pinned server certificates, trusted URLs configuration options. And, since we want OTA-update functionality, we need to keep the same amount of flash memory as consumed by the application image free for a new version of it. That leaves us with 1.5 MB of flash for our application image, which is not too far away from our current 1 MB. Therefore, I think it is justified to think about size reduction before that problem stops us from introducing new features at all. I do realize that 60 kB of unwanted vfprintf() functions is a small part of 1 MB, but we do need a lot of actually helpful libraries (mbedtls for encryption, a full IP-stack, a thin web server, ...).

(I will explain better below: User Table Tree table Below is the tree generated from this table How i update the leftCount and rightCount when a user registers Functions used All this is working just fine but then I need to implement something and I haven’t found the best way around it. I need to keep changing the rank for each user if they have attained a stage. see below and example: Up to stage 2, I have no problem but upwards is where I cant get my hands on the right logic Update for example: The numbers of growbig's can come from anywhere on the legs, it shouldn’t just be direct nodes, just a count of ranks all below that user on each sides UPDATE: Re-asking in a clearer term and specifications its a binary tree (2:2) which means a person can only have two people directly under them (one on the left and another on the right. With the picture above my table looks like this Tree table Note: its not compulsory for a user to have anyone under him on any side or both. it means if a user have nobody under him then the tree (branch) ends there, if he has one person directly on the left and none on the right it means the left branch can continue to grow. The logic to grade each user base on their growths and how they have managed to balance the growth on each side is the problem. The logic Rank 1: supervisor: user must have at 3 users on its right branch and 3 users on the left branch. Rank 2: controller: user must have 7 users who are 'supervisors' on it's left and 7 users who have become supervisors on the right too. Rank 3: Senior Controller: user must have 7 users who are 'controller' on the left branch and have 7 'controller' on the right too. Rank 4: Ambassador: user must have 7 users who are senior controller on its left and 7 senior controllers on the right Rank 5: Senior Ambassador: user must have 7 users who are ambassadors on the left and same on the right. Rank 6: Grand Ambassador: user must have 7 users who are senior ambassadors on his both sides. Explanation: let me pick on rank and explain it: Rank: Ambassador- if user with ID 3 has 45 people on its right hand side and 7 of the people on its right branch are senior controllers and also on the left he has 67 people and 7 are already senior controllers then user with ID 3 should be upgraded to 'ambassador' @blag"},{"id":46440727,"title":"http2 doesn't work on nginx 1.12 - debian8","created_at":"2017-09-27 06:18:26.050000+00:00","modified_at":"2017-09-27 08:02:54.103000+00:00","tags":["nginx","gunicorn","http2","nginx-reverse-proxy"],"path":"","file_type":"blog","language":"en","github_stars":0,"view_count":0,"source":"Stack Overflow","content":"I'm setting up on the .

Finding median of N-elements in ordinary data is as follows. 1. sort the data of N-elements (ascending or descending order) 2. If N is odd, median is the (N+1)/2 th element in the sorted array. 3. If N is even, median is the average of the N/2 th and N/2+1 th elements in the sorted array. However, the wrap around problem in the circular data takes the problem to a different dimension and the solution non-trivial. A similar question to find mean from circular data is explained here How do you calculate the average of a set of circular data? The suggestion in the above link is to find the unit vector corresponding to each angle and find the average.

I'm working on an app that will go in a race car. It will give the driver the ability to press a button to mark a Start/Finish line. It will also have a button to allow a driver to set segment times. Keep in mind a track can be an oval which I'm working on first. It could be a road course or it could be an auto cross where the start and finish line aren't the exact same location. They could be with 50 feet of each other or so but the car never crosses where it starts. I have my gps data coming in and I convert the NMea messages to my classes and I store Lat, Lon, Speed, Course etc. In my research I've ran across this which is interesting. The GPS will be mounted outside the roof for better signal. It generates 10 hits per second. (Garmin Glo) http://www.drdobbs.com/windows/gps-programming-net/184405690?pgno=1 It's old but it talks about UTM and the Cartesian coordinate system. So using the DecDeg2UTM, I convert Lat & Lon to X & coordinates as well. I've also been trying to use the Intersect formula I found Here I took the intersect and tried to convert it to C# which I'll post at the end. However, feeding coordinates of an oval track, it doesn't seem to be working. Also, I'm not sure exactly what it's supposed to be doing. But the coordinates it returns when it does somethign like -35.xxx & 98.xxxx which out in an ocean somewhere 1000's of miles from where the track is. I looking for answers to the following. I assume I need to take the location recorded when a button is pressed for Start/Finish or Segment and calculate a line perpendicular to the direction the car in able to be able to do some sort of Line Intersection calculation. The Cartesian coordinates seems to calculate the bearing fairly well. But the question here is how do you get the \"left and right coordinates\". Also, keep in mind, an oval track may be 60 feet wide. But as mentioned an auto cross track may only be 20 ft wide and part of the track may be with 50 ft. Note I'm fine with indicating to set the points, the car needs to be going slow or stopped at the points to get an accurate coordinate. Some tracks they will have to be set while walking the track. Based on this, should I be trying to use decimal lat lon or would utilizing the Cartesian coordinate system based on UTM be a more accurate method for what I'm trying to do? Either one is there a .Net library or C based library with source code that has methods for making these calculations? How can this be accurately handled. (Not that great with Math, links to code samples would help tremendously.) Next, after I have the lines or whatever is needed for start/finish and segments, as I get GPS sign from the car racing, I need to figure out the most accurate way to tell when a car has crossed those segments. again if I'm lucky I'll get 10 hits per second but it will probably be lower. Then the vehicle speeds could vary significantly depending on the type of track and vehicle. So the GPS hit could be many feet \"left or right\" of a segment. Also, it could be many feet before or after a segment. Again, if there is a GIS library out there I can feed coordinates and all this is calculated, that's would work as well as long as it's performant. If not again I'm trying to decide if it's best to break down coordinates to X Y or some geometry formulas for coordinates in decimal format. Mods, I assume there is hard data to support an answer of either way and this isn't responses aren't fully subjective to opinions. Here is the C# code I came up with from the Script page above. I'm starting to feel UTM and the Cartesian Coordinate system would be better for accuracy and performance. But again I'm open to evidence to the contrary if it exists. Thanks P.S. Note GeoCoordinate is from the .Net System.Device.Location assemble. GpsData is just a class I use to convert NMEA messages into Lat, Lon, Course, NumSats, DateTime etc. The degree Radian methods are extensions as as follows."},{"id":46239016,"title":"Handle file upload with Selenium Server Standalone","created_at":"2017-09-15 11:56:46.690000+00:00","modified_at":"2018-05-23 23:44:24.393000+00:00","tags":["java","selenium-webdriver","selenium-server"],"path":"","file_type":"blog","language":"en","github_stars":0,"view_count":0,"source":"Stack Overflow","content":"I try to execute testsuite on a remote host with use of .

Why don't they give the same result? I would think that subtracting two int32_t variables would yield a result of type int32_t, so using a temporary of that type shouldn't change anything.
